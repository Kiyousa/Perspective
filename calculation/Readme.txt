# Here is the discription about 3 files
# GetProjectiveMatrix.py contains how to determine a projective transform matrix by 4-pair points (8 points)
# cv2test.py shows a useage of cv2.getProjectiveMatrix of OpenCV library, same function as GetProjectiveMatrix(which write on my own)
# Projection&Draw.py gives a excample of how a circle on xy-plane is projected on y=1 plane, and demostrate it by matplotlib.
# quadratic curve.py shows how to compute a quadratic curve after projective transformation
# draw_circle shows draw the parameter euqation that has been solved out.
