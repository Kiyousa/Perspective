# Here is the discription for the files
# GetProjectiveMatrix.py helps to determine a projective transform matrix by 4-pair points (8 points)
# cv2test.py demonstrates a useage of cv2.getPerspectiveTransform of OpenCV library, same function as GetProjectiveMatrix (which write on my own)
# Projection&Draw.py gives a example of how a circle on xy-plane is projected on y=1 plane, and then draws a demo of it via "matplotlib".
# quadratic curve.py demonstrates how to compute a quadratic curve after projective transformation
# draw_circle shows how to draw the parameter euqation that has been solved out.
